# CNN-Computer-Parts-Classification-by-ImageScraper

# Image Scraper
We Have use image scraper with chrome driver to scrap the images for training,
to use image scraper-
1. Run the chrome driver in same directry
2.Then open img_scrape.ipynb file 
3. Mension the no of images you required 
4.Change the output directry according to your preference
5. Done , It will automaticly save the images for you

# CNN Model building for computer part classification

I have used 6 classes of computer parts like- CPU,Monitor,Mouse,Keybord,SSD,Webcam

I used 100 epochs,To increase the accuracy you can increase the epochs
